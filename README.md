# Leapfrog 60 days of learning


Welcome to my journey through **Leapfrog's 60 Days of Learning** challenge
This repository is a daily log of what I learn, build and explore as I move towards becoming a better developer
a day at a time.

Timeline:
Start:- June 1, 2025
End: July 30, 2025


Goal:
To build strong foundations in Web Development, React, Backend and possibly more. Along with that improve my consistency and documentation as well


This repo will contain a directory for each day, where i'll upload my logs.
